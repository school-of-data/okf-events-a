description: A training to help civil servants operationalise geographical data and tools for public health and disaster response.

### Context 

Last year, Facebook publicly released  the world’s most accurate population density maps for 170+ countries, built with satellite imagery and projected census data. This data has already had impact on life-saving service delivery, such as during the 2016-2017 measles and rubella campaign in Malawi, where the data allowed Missing Maps Program volunteers to reach  95% of children under five with vaccinations. Today these maps are used around the world to help plan local electricity grids, analyse hospital accessibility, or deploy COVID19 interventions. 

There are vast opportunities for civil servants and non-profits to make use of this public data to improve the delivery of a variety of projects, from vaccination campaigns to pandemic response to infrastructure planning. With a little bit of training and support, civil servants could become much more efficient at using geographical data and tools, thereby multiplying the impact of their agencies on the populations they serve. 


### Objectives

Objectives
To address this need, Facebook’s Data for Good team has partnered with the Open Knowledge Foundation to design a free and open source geographical information system (GIS) training programme for governments around the world. The programme will aim to:
 
- Raise awareness about the free GIS resources available to governments
- Teach participants the skills needed to use these resources for public health and disaster response 
- Familiarize governments with Facebook’s Population Density Map for their country
- Create space for governments to innovate in their practices by making use of data


### The Training

The training programme will be split into two phases, both delivered remotely: 

- Two days of live sessions on Zoom where participants will learn about how to use, analyse and share geographical data in a public health and disaster response context
- 4 weeks of mentoring, where participants will progress at their pace on small projects allowing them to apply what they’ve learned to their day to day work.
 

The requested time commitment of the nominated participants will thus amount to over the course of five weeks--two days on Zoom and roughly one day per week over the 4 weeks of mentoring. Between 10 to 15 participants are expected. They will receive a certificate at the end of the training and gain access to a supplemental GIS curriculum to further their learning. Ideally, participants should be

- working on public health or disaster response programmes, and
- directly involved in the planning, coordination or delivery of these programmes
 

The projects that participants take on during the mentoring phase will be decided based on their skill level and the needs of their work. Some example projects:

- An updated process for generating COVID19 contamination maps
- An analysis of health infrastructure accessibility
- A new open dataset related to public health
- A report on the gaps in the data needed to improve disaster response


### The team

**Facebook’s Data For Good** team makes data available to researchers, non profits, and the public sector, enabling them to address some of the world’s greatest humanitarian issues. Our partners leverage this data to address disaster response, health, connectivity, energy access, and economic growth. Privacy is built into all of our products by default; we use techniques such as aggregation and differential privacy to protect privacy. We have public datasets which are available on the Humanitarian Data Exchange, and private datasets which are only available to vetted non profits and researchers. 


**Open Knowledge Foundation (OKF)** is a global non-profit organisation focused on realising open data’s value to society by helping individuals and organisations access and use data to take action on social problems. OKF coordinates several global networks of non-profits and individuals aligned with its mission, including School of Data, a network of data trainers spanning more than 30 countries.
